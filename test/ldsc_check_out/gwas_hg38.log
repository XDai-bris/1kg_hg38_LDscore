Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
P:	p-Value
N:	Sample size

Reading sumstats from gwas_for_ldsc.tsv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
WARNING: 6 SNPs had P outside of (0,1]. The P column may be mislabeled.
Read 11977208 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 6 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 1800919 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
10176283 SNPs remain.
Removed 5615 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (10170668 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 305216.0 (10170668 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -1.6702299999999998e-05, which seems sensible.
